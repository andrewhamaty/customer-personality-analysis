# Grocery Store Customer Segmentation and Marketing Campaign Analysis 

This project focuses on understanding grocery store customer behavior through clustering analysis. 

The complete analysis, including data loading, clustering, and campaign performance assessment, is documented in the `main.ipynb` notebook. The raw grocery store data used for this project is stored in the `marketing.duckdb` database.

## Contents 
* **`main.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains all the code for the data analysis, from loading the data to generating insights and visualizations. 

* **`marketing.duckdb`**: This file is a DuckDB database containing the raw data
used for the analysis.

* **`queries/load_data.sql.duckdb`**: The query I used to load my data in the main notebook.

## To Run:
* This project utilizes `uv` for managing dependencies and running the notebook.
